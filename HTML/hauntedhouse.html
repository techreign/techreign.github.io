		I am not the best at telling stories, but this one is quite near and dear to me. There was once a lady
		who lived with her husband in a large manor near the corner of a small village. They loved eachother
		dearly, and spent all their free time happily together. <br/>
		
		But one day, something changed. The husband became a lot more distant and would randomly start fights
		with the poor old lady. Soon, she discovered that he was cheating on her with another woman from the village. </br>
		
		She killed her husband by stabbing a knife through his heart, and not long after did the same to herself. A
		rather similar but more tragic Romeo and Juliet, I would say. <br />
		
		Rumour had it that her ghosts still haunts the house. A brave little kid named Jim wanted to see if this
		was true, as he did not believe in ghosts. <br />
		
		Jim approached the "haunted" house and to his surprise he saw a shadow figure from the window.

		He quickly hid behind some bushes. 	<i class="fa fa-cloud" style="color:green;"> </i> <br/>
		
		Then... all of a sudden, the widow's ghost came out and grabbed him! AND STABBED HIM IN THE HEART!
